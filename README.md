- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBossaaa, it is written with triple "a" as someone already took the version with single "a".
- 👀 I’m in love with Game Development, from creative to technical I do all aspects of game development (except sound design).
- 🌱 I’m at intermediate+ level in C# and Unity. I plan to continue my learning path with C++ with Unreal and Python for AI
