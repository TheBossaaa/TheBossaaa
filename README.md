- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBossaaa, it is written with triple "a" as someone already took the version with 1 "a".
- 👀 I’m interested in Game and App development and it's been 1 year since I started my self-taught journey. I have graduated from MSc Innovation Management, Strategy and Entrepreneurship but without coding I discovered I am nothing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# with Unity and I will continue my learning path with C++ with Unreal and Python for AI
- 💞️ I'm entrepreneurial full with ideas. I am deeply interested in academic research and am considering pursuing a PhD in the future. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the academic community and advance the field of gamification and innovation in business. 
- With my diverse skill set and willingness to learn, I believe I have much to offer and am excited about the possibility of collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations. I am looking forward to collaborate on videogame and app development projects.
- 📫 It is best to reach me through my email: ogulakol@gmail.com or my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/himmetogulakol/
